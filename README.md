#Hackathon for creative people: hackers, designers and storytellers

###Problem Statement:

The year is 2050, scientists have predicted an unfortunate event. A really big meteor has entered the earth's trajectory and it is approaching towards earth. The collision of the meteor with the earth which is predicted to be in Dec 2052, will destroy everything.

Scientists have located another planet "Biome-1109" where life is possible. We will be moving people and the resources from earth to Biome-1109.

Biome-1109 is quite similar to earth and has an exact similar communication digital network deployed as ours. We can use that to streamline usage of resources intelligentally.

You are one of the excellent team member of this rehabilitation program. We all have decided to let people trade their resources(e.g. clothes, food, electronics, machines etc.) in exchange of a virtual currency "Kard". 'Kards' can be used to book resources on Biome-1109 including priority to transport to Biome-1109.

The job will require multiple systems to streamline the process, choose one which you can do the best

1. A system to educate people about the collision, it's impact and the way forward(trading resources and migrating)
2. A system to trade your resources in exchange of 'Kards'
3. A system to pre-book resources on Biome-1109
4. A central monitoring system of resources and trading
5. An algorithm to priorotize selection of the people based on total kards (e.g. value of kards should be defined by tangible(physical resources) and intangible(education, contribution to the community) value of persion)
6. Your idea to help save the world

#####Assumptions:
Every person on the earth has at least one smart phone with data connectivity, through intelligent migration the same will work on Biome-1109.

#####Instructions:
The system should be a minimum viable product. 
App developers need not to develop apis, use dummy data instead. Code it!
Backend developers need not to develop apps, just design the data structure, architecture and REST APIs. Code it!
For everybody else, do what you are good at.
 
#####For evaluation we will need
1. Flow diagram/data structure/Screenshots if applicable
2. Code, shared through your github or bitbucket repository
3. Instructions to run/install the program


Happy coding!
